# Aloha!
## Intro to Web


HawaiianMafia is currently a college student who has always wanted to learn code and is excited to learn it this semester! HawaiianMafia is from Hawaii but is not actually in the mafia (just in case anyone was wondering). HawaiianMafia wants to one day be involved in Children's Programs and be able to develop websites for them. HawaiianMafia has a large selection of hobbies that range from playing sports and video games to reading books and embroidering like a grandma. Mahalo for reading, and have a great day!
