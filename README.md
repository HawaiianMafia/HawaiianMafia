# Aloha!
## Intro to Web


HawaiianMafia is currently a college student who has always wanted to learn code and is excited to learn it this semester! HawaiianMafia is from Hawaii but is not actually in the mafia (just in case anyone was wondering). HawaiianMafia wants to one day be involved in Children's Programs and be able to develop websites for them. HawaiianMafia has a large selection of hobbies that range from playing sports and video games to reading books and embroidering like a grandma. Mahalo for reading, and have a great day!

## Inspiration 

The website [ETQ](https://www.etq-amsterdam.com/) has a very nice and clean look. Not only does it look nice, but I love the moving pictures. I want to have something like this in my future website. [Push10] (https://www.push10.com/) also has moving elements. However, the elements are not just pictures, but also text. Push10 also has a menu button that I would like to put in my website. [Deepblue] (http://deepblue.com/) has a picture collage that would great to display different elements on a website. These elemenst could be pictures or even links. 

# My Website and My Goals
## My Website
I would love to be able to create a website that presents all the stages of a project. It would be a picture uploading platform that enables people to see every stage of a project from start to finish, and allows people to ask or give advice, encourage, and share ideas. 
## My Goals
The Goal of the website is to let people show the whole process of a project. Let people see something that started as nothing and grew into something beautiful. Most times we just see the finished project, but this webiste would allow people to see pictures of what each step of the process looked like. The website would need to allow people to upload pictures and text. For now I would like to show what my process of the website is. I would need to upload screenshots and disciptions to the website. The two biggest goals right now is to learn how to add pictures and how to add a comment section.
